      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>
        I am a student in MART 145 Web Design, where I have explored the 
        fundamentals of visual design, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Throughout the 
        course, I have learned how to build structured, responsive, and visually 
        engaging web pages. I enjoy applying design concepts to create websites 
        that look clean, organized, and easy to navigate.

      <h2>My Interests</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond web design, I enjoy working with technology, photography, 
        and digital creativity. I like experimenting with color, layout, and 
        motion to bring ideas to life online. I also enjoy learning new tools 
        that help me expand my design abilities.

      <h2>What I Learned in MART 145</h2>
      <p>
        This course helped me develop a strong understanding of coding structure, 
        accessibility, folder organization, and responsive design. It gave me 
        hands-on practice creating real projects that demonstrate my growth.

      <h2>My Goals</h2>
      <p>
        As I continue building my portfolio, I want to explore more advanced 
        interactive elements such as animations, jQuery effects, and dynamic 
        layouts. My goal is to keep improving my design skills and build 
        professional-quality projects. I want to be able to continue the process of combining all my work into fun interactive unique experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
